### Back to ~/ 
 End-Sem Vacations!!!
So, after a tiring first semester, I am back to my home. I spent the last three days working on Inter-IIT Open Soft-Coding Problem to get my team selected for the upcoming competition at IIT-Kharagpur.

We made a java program to format a query string to search on Google Scholar and were able to successfully fetch the results page source code. We had already laid out our basic design layout using drag and drop from the NetBeans Palette. This was shown to a third-year senior of ours who was supposed to select between us and a second-year's team for the competition. The major portion left in our application was to parse the useful information from fetched source-code and display it in a digestible format to the user. Even if we don't get selected, I am happy to have learnt a lot in a limited time about fetching of webpages and HTML codes of large web-pages.

When I came back to Ujjain, I decided to do coding in a non-Virtual_Machine environment. Besides Dual-Boot, I was looking for options to compile and run my programs straight from Windows. I had already used Turbo C and felt it was too outdated to be used. Therefore I installed Dev-C++ from my setups treasure and my files were compiling in it but not running due to "Source File Not Compiled" error. I looked it up on internet and found out on stackoverflow.com that for Windows 8.1, a newer version Orwell Dev-C++ was required. I uninstalled the previous one and installed the new one. Ta-Da !!! My programs ran successfully now .

But still I missed the Linux feel to it, therefore I installed CygWin Terminal onto my laptop and rushed through the installation process. You can find more about installing it on one of my posts.

Once installed the Linux-terminal simulator, I thought of learning about some standard Linux terminal commands and vim shortcuts. I found them out on Linux Command and Vim Shortcuts
